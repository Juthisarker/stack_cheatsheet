# Setting Up and Activating a Virtual Environment (Windows)

## 1. Creating a Virtual Environment

To create a virtual environment in Python on Windows, use the following command:

```bash
python -m venv v-name
```

Replace `v-name` with the name of your virtual environment.

## 2. Activating the Virtual Environment

Once the virtual environment is created, you can activate it with this command:

```bash
v-name\Scripts\activate
```

Replace `v-name` with the name of the virtual environment you've created.

After activation, you will see the virtual environment's name in your command prompt.
